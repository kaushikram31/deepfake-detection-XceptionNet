# "Deepfake-detection" with Explainable AI
This repo contains the code, results, models for Deep Fake detection with XAI. Course Project for ECE 792 - Advanced Machine Learning

**Project Motive and Description**
* To classify real and fake images, pretrained XceptionNet model is implemented.
* For model interpretability, algorithms such as LIME and Grad-CAM are implemented.
* The objective of this project is to incorporate explainable AI (XAI) techniques to gain insights into the interpretability of the model. The project utilizes state-of-the-art XceptionNet to detect deepfakes, and then employs LIME and GradCam algorithms to visualize and analyze how the model interprets the results.
* Images were used instead of Videos from the dataset and a python script was written to extract images from the videos.
* FaceForensic++ and Celeb-DF Datasets were used for model training and testing
